This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming: attempting to create multiple mutable references to the same variable.  The code in `bug.rs` showcases this issue, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version.  Rust's ownership and borrowing system prevents data races and other concurrency problems, making it a safe and efficient language.  This example highlights the importance of understanding and correctly utilizing Rust's borrowing rules.
